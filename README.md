The jupyter notebook file contains all detailed information and explanation regarding every operation mentioned throughout the report. The report (file: *group2_slides_presentation.pdf*), therefore, does not replace the notebook to fully understand the whole data analysis carried out.


## **Research Question**

“What are the key factors that determine a higher/lower traffic accident severity in the USA?” 

To answer this question, we will examine three sub questions concerning three major factors:

* To what extent do weather conditions impact the severity of traffic accidents?
* To what extent do time conditions impact the severity of traffic accidents?
* To what extent do infrastructure conditions impact the severity of traffic accidents?

Furthermore, we will study the accident by geographical distribution throughout the country by states and cities; by date (months and days of the week) where accidents are prevalent; by duration in hours; and by distance in traffic congestion.

This study will help the authorities to better understand traffic problems and to establish public policies to minimize this critical issue, and for example for insurance companies to define their commercial policy. If we can identify the patterns of how these serious accidents happen and the key factors, we might be 
able to implement well-informed actions and better allocate financial and human resources.
